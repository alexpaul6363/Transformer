# Transformer
Health Monitor

This project monitors critical parameters of a transformer (temperature, load current, and oil level) using ESP32 and sends data to ThingSpeak for remote monitoring.

## 📌 Features
- Real-time sensor data monitoring
- LCD display output
- IoT dashboard (ThingSpeak)
- Useful for predictive maintenance

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Embedded C (Arduino IDE)
- ESP32 microcontroller
- ThingSpeak API
- DHT11, CT Sensor, LCD

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Connect sensors to ESP32 as per schematic.
2. Update Wi-Fi credentials and ThingSpeak API key in the code.
3. Upload the code using Arduino IDE.
4. View real-time data on ThingSpeak dashboard.
